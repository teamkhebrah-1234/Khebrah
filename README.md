## About Khibrah

Khibrah is an AI-powered platform designed to bridge the gap between academic learning
and real-world job requirements.

The platform allows students and fresh graduates to complete short, realistic
task-based simulations that reflect real workplace activities.

Through automated AI evaluation, continuous skill tracking, and portfolio generation,
Khibrah helps users discover hidden skills such as leadership, problem-solving,
creativity, and time management.

At the same time, employers can observe real performance instead of relying only
on CVs and interviews.
